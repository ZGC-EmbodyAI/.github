## 📖 About Us

**ZGC-EmbodyAI** is a joint research group established by the **Zhongguancun Academy (ZGCA)** and the **Zhongguancun Institute of Artificial Intelligence (ZGCI)**.

Our core mission is to develop **General Physical AI**.

### 🔬 Research Focus

* 🤖 **Post-training of LLMs & Agents:** Advanced post-training techniques (e.g., SFT, RLHF) tailored for Large Language Models and autonomous agents to enhance reasoning and planning.
* 🦾 **VLA Architecture & Training:** Designing and optimizing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architectures for effective end-to-end robotic control.
* 🌏 **World Models in Embodied AI:** Leveraging World Models to simulate, predict, and reason about physical interactions and dynamics.
* 🛩︎ **Real-world Reinforcement Learning:** Deploying robust RL algorithms on physical hardware, including Robotic Arms, Dexterous Hands, and Humanoid Robots.

## 📝 Selected Publications

Below are our latest research contributions in the field of Embodied AI:

### PhysBrain: Human Egocentric Data as a Bridge from Vision Language Models to Physical Intelligence
> **Abstract:** An egocentric-aware embodied brain, PhysBrain, trained on E2E-3M, exhibits substantially improved egocentric understanding for planning tasks, provides sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning initialization, and achieves 53.9% SimplerEnv success rates—demonstrating effective transfer from human egocentric supervision to downstream robot control.
